# Sentiment Analysis of COVID-19 Vaccine Tweets

The proposed model uses a collection of tweets to conclude sentiments of the people toward the vaccination when vaccinations are accessible to the population.

## Salient features of software

- Techniques based on sentiment analysis and NLP is used to insights on COVID-19 vaccinations.
- People's attitude towards the vaccination is analysed.
- A model to determine the user's sentiment and opinion towards vaccination and finding the algorithm which gives the best accuracy is designed and developed.

## Variables used

- Tweets: Here the size of the data to be extracted is specified. 
- Keyword: This indicates the specific word that has to be present in the extracted data. 
- Polarity: It indicates how positive or negative the dataset is. It ranges from -1 to 1 with -1 being negative and 1 being positive.
- Subjectivity: It indicates if the information in the dataset is based on facts or opinions. It ranges from 0 to 1 where 0 means it is based on facts and 1 being based on opinion.
- Sentiments: The dataset is classified into positive, negative and neutral based on the prediction from the algorithms.

## Installation and Deployment

Install 'sentimentanalysis' with npm

```bash
  npm install sentimentanalysis
  cd sentimentanalysis
```
```bash
  1. Obtain your Twitter API credentials.
  2. Replace appropriate credentials in sentiments.py file.
  3. Install all the required modules and libraries from requirements.txt .
  4. Run the flask server using python main.py to see the result on port 5000(by default).
  5. Go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to see the front-end.
  6. To see the actual analysis run all .ipynb files.
